# ATMega328P Trainer

Basic board for practicing with the ATMega328P microcontroller. It includes an optocoupled input designed to connect pulse sensors at different voltages, such as an anemometer that operates at 24VDC. It also includes a USB-to-serial adapter that allows you to work with the ATMega's UART.
